## D804 - ADVANCED AI FOR COMPUTER SCIENTISTS
This repository contains two machine learning models developed for the D804 Advanced AI course.
Directories are set up for each model and for each optimization of the models.

## Models
- Model 1 (Advanced): Random Forest classifier predicting exam success (pass/fail).
- Model 2 (Probabilistic): Gaussian Mixture Model clustering video games by release year and global sales.

## Files
- Jupyter notebooks document preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and optimization.
- CSV files contain model outputs and results for review.
- Trained model artifacts (.joblib) are not included due to file size.

## How to Run
Install required packages and run the notebooks from top to bottom.

- python 3.11
- NumPy: 2.4.0
- Pandas: 2.3.3
